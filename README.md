## Projects:

	- TwentyOne Game
	- CarInsurance
	- Final Assignemnt
	- Many More

### TwentyOne Game
> Tech Academy Instructor Jesse walked me through creating a very realistic game of TwentyOne (also known as blackjack).  We used a .NET Framework Console app, delving into numerous classes and methods to ensure the game ran smoothly and was well-organized.

### CarInsurance
> I created an ASP.NET Web Application MVC to develop a website that provides car insurance quotes. The quotes were influenced by various factors, such as the make, model, and year of the vehicle, as well as specific vehicles being more costly to insure. Additional factors included the number of speeding tickets or DUIs.

### Final Assignment
> For the final assignment, I built an Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a database for students and adds a student.
